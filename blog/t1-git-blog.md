# Gitting it Together
## Reflections on Version Control
### September 10, 2015</h3>

When I first started to explore web development, I remember searching for templates and code samples, which inevitably led me to GitHub.  I had this idea that only "real" developers used GitHub, and it was this wonderful universe for the highly-intelligent super-humans who know how to use it.  Now that I have discovered version control, I still think about it that way, except I now count myself among the highly intelligent super-humans who know how to use it.

So, apart from making you look like a "real" developer, version control just makes sense.  It's like a time machine that allows you go track changes and store all the earlier versions of your files. It also helps to resolve arguments on a team, as you don't have to worry about overwriting anyone else's code or sending multiple copies of a file back and forth.  Seeing everyone's changes in one place makes your life *much easier*.

Git is the most common program for version control.  Git allows you store your changes in "commits", or snapshots of your files as they exist right now.  This can be a code, text, or even an image file.  You can keep these commits to yourself on your own computer, or you can show off your stuff by pushing these commits to GitHub.

**Very Important Note:** Git is NOT the same thing as GitHub.  Git is a program you can use on your own computer without ever posting anything on GitHub.  Pushing to GitHub is optional, though like I said, it makes you look like a highly-intelligent super-human.

GitHub is a community.  As we write code and become better developers, we're not doing it aloneâ€”we're sharing the experience with others, too.  And that, to me, is the best part.
