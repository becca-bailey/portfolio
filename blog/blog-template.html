    <h2>Version Control to Major Tom </h2>

    <h4>Straight to the Web Dev Stratosphere </h4>

    <h6>Sept. 14</h6>

    <p>After a week-long forced march through the rigors of Git and GitHub, I seem to have a few clues as to what they were created for. </p>

    <p><strong>What are the benefits of version control?</strong></p>

    <p>Version control allows a programmer to keep track of a project under various stages and with various changes. Within the context of a team, it enables programmers to compare versions, choose the elements that are best and credit the proper contributor. In a discipline that's based on trial and (mostly) error, version control helps maintain programmers' sanity.</p>

    <p><strong>How does git help you keep track of changes?</strong></p>

    <p>git allows me to commit versions of the same work, keeping track of infinite options that I can revert to and merge if needed. It lives in the command line, making everything simple and easier to tame.</p>

    <p><strong>Why use GitHub to store your code?</strong></p>

    <p>Storing in GitHub in public mode allows everyone to contribute to a given project. It also allows the original creator to keep track of the contributions, give credit to collaborators, pick the best solution without losing other versions.</p>

<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Because wireframing isn't necessarily a code-related task, was a task that was difficult to do together remotely.  In this case, it was difficult for us to make a decision about what we needed to do when the directions were a little unclear.  Creating html was a simpler task, but we didn't have a lot of tiem to dedicate to it as a pair once we got started.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

In general, it does help to have a visual reference, but in this case, I'm not sure how helpful it was to have a wireframe just of the post elements (title, meta, content.)

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

It should be something that is simple, and has a clear structure with navigation and links to the main page.  It was a learning experience to discuss different takes on wireframing and what is necessary for this assignment.  We decided that it it's a part of the process and not the end result, so we don't need to spend lots of time worrying about making a perfect wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

We discussed html vs. css and what needs to be included in the html using semantic tags.  For me, we didn't use any unfamiliar semantic elements. -->
