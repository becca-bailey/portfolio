        <h2>I'm great at WordPress.</h2>
        <p>In July, I started a WordPress help blog.  I have been working with clients, doing small fixes, editing PHP templates, transferring and setting up new blogs.  You can click to link below to see my current portfolio.</p>

        <h2>This is my story.</h2>
        <p>People ask me sometimes why I chose to become a web developer, and I usually tell them it was an accident. I was a teacher for about five years before I caught the bug. I woke up one day, and wanted to be more in charge of my career and my life.</p>

        </p>I started by teaching myself some HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I thought that was super fun, so I enrolled in more classes, and I am currently a student at Dev Bootcamp in Chicago. I got hooked on code, and my life has never been quite the same.</p>
