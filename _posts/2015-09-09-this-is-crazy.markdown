##This is crazy.

It seems that Phase 0 is upon me, and its inevitable presence in my schedule is causing a bit of a disruption in my *wasting my life on twitter* time.  However, I think it might be worth it.

I can tell already that this experience will be a bit of a growing experience for me.  Not only will I have to improve my time management, but I will also need to give and receive lots of feedback.  SO MUCH FEEDBACK.  We have to give and receive feedback on each pairing session, and also give feedback on each piece of feedback to rate whether it is Actionable, Specific, and Kind.

I don't know about you, but I've always been a little afraid of feedback.  I'm usually pretty content to mind my own business, and assume that I'm doing okay.  To invite feedback is to invite the possibility that I might be less "okay" than I thought.  *Perhaps I'm not good at this.  Perhaps I'm better off working alone.*

As a teacher, I usually received feedback something like once a year.  Administrators occasionally popped into my classroom, but were usually too busy to give me any sort of formalized feedback other than the once-a-year staff review.  Thinking back to those days, my major frustration was the lack of communication.  It happend more than once that I was criticized for something at the end of the year that I could have fixed months before if I had only known about it.

So, feedback is good.  And feedback is hard.  Feedback is inviting someone else to speak truth to you that perhaps you didn't want to hear.  But perhaps at the end of it all, we will all be a little bit better for it.
